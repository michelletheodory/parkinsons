First, download the dataset.csv file. You will need Jupyter Notebook to run this code. Make sure this is downloaded and read the dataset into that. You will need numpy, pandas, sklearn (sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.datasets, sklearn.svm, metrics, preprocessing, sklearn.naive_bayes, sklearn.ensemble), matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn downloaded and imported. Once this is done, run through the model line by line. Ensure you do not do this out of order, otherwise the model will not work.
